- [ ] Maintain 80%+ code coverage at all times
- [ ] Run tests continuously in watch mode

### **Before Completing Phase 2:**
- [ ] All components have comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] All API integrations have integration tests
- [ ] All critical user journeys have E2E tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established and met
- [ ] Accessibility tests passing (95% WCAG AA)
- [ ] All tests passing in CI/CD pipeline

## 🎉 **Ready to Proceed with Phase 2!**

All testing requirements have been documented and integrated into our development process. We now have:

- ✅ **Comprehensive testing strategy** for all phases
- ✅ **Detailed testing setup** for web application development
- ✅ **Quality gates** preventing incomplete phase progression
- ✅ **Testing documentation** integrated into project docs
- ✅ **Phase 1 fully tested** and validated
- ✅ **Clear testing requirements** for each upcoming phase

**We can now confidently proceed with Phase 2: Web Application Development**, knowing that every feature will be properly tested before moving forward.

The testing foundation ensures we build a robust, reliable, and maintainable dream analysis application with confidence at every step of development.
